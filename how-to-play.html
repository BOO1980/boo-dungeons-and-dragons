    <h1>Dungeons and Dragons How to Play</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery</li>
        <li>Dungeons and Dragond is driven by imagination</li>
        <li>It is about imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challanges that the scene presents</li>
        <li>The possibilities are limitless</li>
        <li>D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers actions</li>
        <li>Players roll the dice to determine whether their attacks hit or miss and whether their character can scale a cliff, roll away from the sgtrike of a magical lightening bolt or pull of some other dangerous task.</li>
        <li>The dice make some things more probable that others</li>
        <li>When you play D&D you take on the role of an adventurer, a skilled fighter, a devout cleric, a deadly rogue or a spellcasting wizard</li>
        <li>With some friends and a little imagination you strike out on grand quests and daring adventures, testing yourself against an array of challanges and blood thirsty monsters.</li>
        <li>One player takes on the role of the Dungeon Master, the games lease storyteller and referer</li>
        <li>The DM is in charge of the adventure which appears in the adventure book, while the characters navigate the adventures hazards and decide where to explore</li>
        <li>The DM might describe the entrance to Cragmore Castle, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do
            <ul>
                <li>Will they bodly stride up to the fallen gate?</li>
                <li>Or try to sneak up in case anyone's watching through the arrow slits</li>
                <li>Circle arround the castle looking for another entrace</li>
                <li>Will they cast a spell to cloak themselves in invisibility</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The DM determines the results of the adventurers actions and narrates what the chatacters experience</li>
        <li>Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempts D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and exciting and unexpected</li>
        <li>There is no winning and losing in D&D at least not in the way those terms are usually understood</li>
        <li>Together the DM and the players create a story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils</li>
        <li>Sometimes might come to a grisly end, torn apart by monsters or done in by a nefarious villian, even so the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to reviv theri fallen comrade</li>
        <li>Or a player might choose to play a new character</li>
        <li>A group might fail to complete an adventure successfully but if the players had a good time and created a memorable story they all win</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player chooses one character from the five options included.</li>
        <li>Its up to the players to turn these bare bone characters into people by giving them names and bringing them to life while playing through the adventure</li>
        <li>Two players can have the same character as long as they can make the details of the character distinct</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Game Dice</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The game uses the polyhedral dice that come with this set</li>
        <li>The different dice are reffered to by the letter d followed by the numbber of sides
            <ul>
                <li>d4</li>
                <li>d6</li>
                <li>d8</li>
                <li>d10</li>
                <li>d20</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Structure of play</h2>
    <ul><li>D&D cosists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the DM presents</li>
    <li>The adventure is the heart of the game</li>
    <li>An adventure unfolds as the story that the DM and the other players tell together using the material in the adventure book, in antoher published adventure or in a setting of the DMS creation </li>
    <li>The DM sets the scene at the start, giving the adventures a reason to get involved </li>
    <li>The adventurers are the protagonists of the story</li>
    <li>The adventurers control what they do and the DM controls the monstors and the people the adventurers meet</li>
    <li>The DM also controls hows the world changes as a result of the adventurers actions</li>
    <li>Play of adventure unfolds according to this basic pattern:
        <ul>
            <li>The DM Describes the enviroments</li>
            <li>The DM tells the players where their adventures are and whats around them, presenting the basic scope of options available </li>
            <li>How many doors lead out of a room, whats on the table, whos in the tavern and so on</li>
            <li>The players ask questions to make sure what theri character percieve</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The Players describe what they want to do</li>
            <li>Sometimes one player speaks for the whole group</li>
            <li>Other times different adventurers do different things, Like one example one adventurer might search a treasure chest, while another searches an esotric symbol engraved on the wall while a third one searches for monsters</li>
            <li>The plauers dont need to take turns but the DM listens to every players and decides how to resolve those actions</li>
            <li>Sometimes resolving a task is easy</li>
            <li>If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describes what lies beyond</li>
            <li>Maybe the door is locked or the floor might have a hidden deadly trap</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>The DM Narrates the results to the adventurers actions</li>
        <li>Describing the result often leads to another decision point which brings the flow of the game back to the DM describing the eniviroment</li>
    <li>The pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring an ancient ruin, talking to a devious prince or locked in mortal combat against a dragon</li>
    <li>In certain situations particulary combat the actions are more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns chooding and resolving actions</li>
    <li>Most of the time play is fluid, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure</li>
    <li>Often the action of an adventure takes place wholly in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DMs verbal descriptions to set the scene</li>
    <li>Some DMS liekto use music, art or recorded sound affects to adopt he mood and many players and DMs like to adopt different voices for the various adventures, monsters and other characters in they play in the game</li>
    <li>Sometimes a DM might layout a map and use tokens or miniatute figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is</li>
</ul>
    </li>
